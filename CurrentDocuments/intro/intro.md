##### INTRODUCTION

**Paragraph 1:** The spatial aggregation of intraspecific individuals, the spatial independence of interspecific individuals, and the uneven distribution of abundance among species are the unifying assertions of unified theories of biodiversity (McGill 2010). 
Moreover, these are the minimally sufficient set of assertions needed to predict or explain a host of biodiversity patterns. 
Yet, while the unification of unified theories under these assertions has revealed how otherwise disparate theories share a similar stochastic geometry, few general explanations exist for the assertions themselves. 
It is not yet known how the assertions are related or whether they too can be unified. 
As of yet, only the uneven distribution of abundance among species has been given a general *a priori* explanation (Locey & White 2013).

**Paragraph 2:** The distribution of abundance among species is generally characterized by the presence of a few abundant species and many rare ones (McGill et al. 2007).
As a distribution of abundance classes, the species abundance distribution (SAD) reveals a decreasing trend in the frequency of increasingly large abundance classes, i.e. the canonical hollow-curve.
The SAD is one of the most intensively studied ecological patterns and is the first pattern a theory of biodiversity should reasonably predict (McGill ...). 
However, while several biodiversity theories predict the form of the SAD with great accuracy, they do not explain why the SAD should be uneven, regardless of the exact form. 
Instead, they *assert* that the SAD is uneven by virtue of their sampling theory or analytical framework (McGill 2010).

**Paragraph 3:** Locey and White (2013) considered the set of all possible unique forms of the SAD having the same total abunance (*N*) and species richness (*S*), i.e. the SAD feasible set. 
The reasoning behind *N* and *S* is simple: at the very least, an SAD is composed of one or more individuals belonging to one or more species.
In short, *N* and *S* are the primary variables needed to construct all possible shapes of the SAD using a conceptually simple mathematical principle: there are finite number of ways that the abundances of *S* unlabeled species can sum to a total abundance of *N*.
Examining the SAD feasible set revealed that the majority of possible SAD shapes were uneven and that the vast majority of shapes in the feasible set explained 75 to 93% of variation in abundance among species (Locey & White 2013).
This provided an *a priori* explanation for uneven SADs, i.e. the vast majority of possible SAD shapes for ecologically realistical values of *N* and *S* are similarly-shaped hollow-curves.

**Paragraph 4:** The SAD feasible set provides a mechanism free explanation for why SADs should take uneven forms.
That is, if nearly all possible shapes or forms of a pattern are uneven or aggregated, then we should expect to see and predict forms that, while varying in their specific shape, are uneven or aggregated.
This begs the question of whether other unifying assertions of unified theories of biodiversity can be explained from similar first principles.
If so, this would suggest that the unifying assertions of unified biodiversity theories that are likewise unified by their similar stochastic geometries, are mechanism free.


**Paragraph 5:**
We address the assertion of spatially aggregated intraspecific individuals by providing an *a priori* explanation for the intraspecific spatial abundance distribution, a.k.a., the species spatial abundance distribution (SSAD). Like the SAD, the SSAD can be expressed as a rank distribution (abundance of a plot or sample vs. rank in abundance) and a frequency distribution (frequency of abundance classes among plots or samples). Also like the SAD, the SSAD often takes a hollow-curve form and hence, a similar form in ranked abundances (Brown ...). 
Finally, and again like the SAD, the SSAD is a spatially implicit distribution of unlabeled individuals. 
But, unlike the SAD, where all species have at least one individual, the SSAD allows zeros, i.e. absence of a species from a plot or sample.
Other than suggesting close ties between the shapes of the SAD and SSAD, these details suggest that the feasible set of the SSAD may be derived in a way similar to that of the SAD, and hence, that the two unifying assertions responsible for these pattern may be a product of the same mathematical principle. 

**Paragraph 6:**
Like the unevenness of the SAD, most unified biodiversity theories explicitly or implicitly assert that the SSAD is aggregated without explaining why it should be. That is, the ubiquity of intraspecific spatial aggregation cannot be explained using a sampling theory that already has aggregation built in, i.e. aggregation is already asserted. But, if one were to explain the ubiquity of intraspecific spatial aggregation by showing that the vast majority of all possible outcomes are aggregated, then this establishes one *a priori* reason to expect aggregation regardless of the process or mechanism that refines it. Here, we show that this is the case for the SSAD by defining its feasible set and characterizing its features.
