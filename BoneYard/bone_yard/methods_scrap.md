For better or worse, ecologists have often focused on the shapes of patterns as evidence for processes and mechanisms. This dates back to the statistical models of Fisher's log-series and Preston's log-normal influence the shapes of the SADs they predicted (cites), the equation for the species-area relationship given by Arrhenius (1921).



In general, ecological theories predict a single form of pattern for a given set of inputs. Ecologists then compare this prediction to an observation and, based on the fit or explained variation, infer support. While ecologists often attach the labels of 'best fit' and 'most likely' to their predictions, they have never asked how many possible alternative outcomes provide a better fit or explain more variation and have only recently considered that most of the possible outcomes explain a large portion of observed variation (Haegeman and Loreau 2008, Locey and White 2013)

**Prior to all possible shapes**
Likewise, attention has been given to the limited shapes of ecological patterns since, at least, the null models of the 1980's that produced random samples of all possible rearrangements of, for example, site by species matrices (cites). Yet by-and-large, ecologists have approached the prediction and explanation of ecological patterns without considering the variation among the possible outcomes, i.e. feasible set.

Though the pitfalls of overparameterizing a model is well known, ecologists rarely ask whether a model fits so well because most of the possible outcomes (predictable and observable) share a high degree of similarity, which is in a way what over-parameterizing a model does (Haegeman and Loreau 2008). 

This started to change several years ago when ecologists began using models based on the principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). MaxEnt models are used to infer the most likely state of a system as that having the most ways of occurring according to some set of constraint-variables.
In theory, MaxEnt models return the most likely outcome from a feasible set of possible outcomes.
In practice, MaxEnt models return a single most likely outcome with no indication of 1.) how much more likely the most likely outcome is than any other, and 2.) without any indication of how greatly the most likely outcome differs from any other. 
Consequently, a MaxEnt model could provide an extremely accurate prediction simply because the information used to parameterize the model reduced the set of possible outcomes to the small set of outcomes that resemble the observed pattern. This was shown by Haegeman and Loreau (2008), who made the first use of an SAD feasible set.

The reason ecologists want to understand the feasible set is because Of course, ecological systems and problems are complex mixtures of random and deterministic processes, mechanisms, and players; if the possible outcomes are not infinite, then they are intractable.
