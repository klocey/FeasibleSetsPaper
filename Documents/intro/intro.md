##### INTRODUCTION

**Paragraph 1:** The spatial aggregation of intraspecific individuals, the spatial independence of interspecific individuals, and the uneven distribution of abundance among species are the unifying assertions of unified theories of biodiversity (McGill 2010). 
Moreover, these are the minimally sufficient set of assertions needed to predict or explain a host of biodiversity patterns. 
Yet, while the unification of unified theories under these assertions has revealed how otherwise disparate theories share a similar stochastic geometry, few general explanations exist for the assertions themselves. 
It is not yet known how the assertions are related or whether they too can be unified. 
As of yet, only the uneven distribution of abundance among species has been given a general *a priori* explanation (see Locey & White 2013).

**Paragraph 2:** The distribution of abundance among species is generally characterized by the presence of a few abundant species and many rare ones (McGill et al. 2007).
As a distribution of abundance classes, the species abundance distribution (SAD) reveals a decreasing trend in the frequency of increasingly large abundance classes, i.e. the canonical hollow-curve.
The SAD is one of the most intensively studied ecological patterns and is the first pattern a theory of biodiversity should reasonably predict (McGill ...). 
However, while several biodiversity theories predict the form of the SAD with great accuracy, they do not explain why the SAD should be uneven, regardless of the exact form. 
They *assert* that the SAD is uneven by virtue of their sampling theory or analytical framework (McGill 2010).

**Paragraph 3:** Locey and White (2013) considered the set of all possible unique forms of the SAD having the same total abunance (*N*) and species richness (*S*), i.e. the SAD feasible set. 
The reasoning behind *N* and *S* is simple: at the very least, an SAD is composed of one or more individuals belonging to one or more species.
In short, *N* and *S* are the primary variables needed to construct an SAD and all possible unique forms of the SAD can be constructed for those constraints using a conceptually simple mathematical principle: there are finite number of ways that the abundances of *S* unlabeled species can sum to a total abundance of *N*.
Examining the SAD feasible set revealed that the majority of possible SAD shapes were uneven and that the vast majority of shapes in the feasible set explained 75 to 93% of variation in abundance among species (Locey & White 2013).
This provided the first *a priori* explanation for uneven SADs, i.e. the vast majority of possible SAD shapes for ecologically realistical values of *N* and *S* are similarly-shaped hollow-curves.

**Paragraph 4:** The SAD feasible set provides a mechanism free explanation for why SADs should take uneven forms.
This begs the question of whether other unifying assertions of unified theories of biodiversity can be explained from similar first principles.
If so, this would suggest that the unifying assertions of unified biodiversity theories that are likewise, unified by their similar stochastic geometries, are mechanism free.

**Paragraph 5:**
Here, we address the assertion of a spatial aggregation of intraspecific individuals by providing an *a priori* explanation for the intraspecific spatial abundance distribution. Like the SAD, most theories explicitly or implicitly assert that the distribution is aggregated, without explaining why it should be. That is, one cannot say, "To explain the ubiquity of intraspecific spatial aggregation, let's consider this process or mechanism that leads to an aggregated pattern." because aggregation is already built into it. But, if one were to say, "To explain the ubiquity of intraspecific spatial aggregation, let's first consider that nearly all possible outcomes are aggregated." then this establishes an *a priori* reason to expect aggregation, regardless of the process or mechanism that refines it.
