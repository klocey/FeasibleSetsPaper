However, before curve fitting can be invoked as support for a theory, it is important to account for how strongly constrained a pattern is by primary variables that may also serve as model inputs.
For example, the shape of the species abundance distribution (SAD) can often be explained by the majority of possible SAD shapes having the same total abundance (*N*) and species richness (*S*), i.e. the SAD feasible set.
The SAD feasible set reveals how *N* and *S* constrain the shape of the SAD and whether the variation that is possible is sufficient for interpreting the SAD shape in terms [DM: don't we mean 'in lieu' here?] of ecological mechanisms or random sampling.
We present a conceptual road map for applying the feasible set approach to 1.) explore how general variables constrain observable variation in the shapes of other ecological patterns, and 2.) examine how the shapes of several ecological patterns are mathematically coupled. [DM: we had discussed trying to put the feasible set into context so that ecologists better know how the feasible set approach compares conceptually to tools such as randomization based null models and/or a neutral model approaches - this may be lower hanging than our current #2]
Additionally, we extend the SAD feasible set to the species spatial abundance distribution (SSAD) using modifications to a previous approach, drastically improving computing speed.
The SSAD feasible set reveals a constraint-based explanation for general patterns in the SSAD and how the shape of the SSAD is mathematically coupled to the shape of the SAD.
Finally, 
We provide Python and R based implementations along with testing software for our methods.
